    * Input: stalls[] = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], k = 3
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0],
        the second cow can be placed at stalls[2] and
        the third cow can be placed at stalls[3].
        The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 3, which also is the largest among all possible ways.
